CEMA Data Science Assignment

The health sector generates big data all over the world. Statistics,
programming and data science can be leveraged to inform data-driven policy 
making to improve healthcare delivery, interventions and resource allocation.

This assignment from CEMA was a great challenge which sharpened my data 
exploration, manipulation and visualisation skills, including generating 
geographical maps.

I was able to evaluate the trends in HIV cases across different countries and
 determine multidimensional poverty indicators associated with HIV. Moreover, I was 
able to examine the trends in child mortality in the East African Community. 
South Sudan, Somalia and the Demorcratic Republic of Congo have the highest 
cases of child mortality in the region.
